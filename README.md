Project Name: Insurance Company AOK Application Test Project

Project Purpose: This project was created to improve myself in the field of software testing and quality assurance. The project is a simulation project that aims to test various processes that an insurance company offers to its customers.

User Stories and Test Scenarios
In my project, I discussed the functions that a user needs to perform certain transactions in the insurance company's application. These user stories were created by me to simulate a real business scenario and are not based on direct data or requirements of any real company.

Project Process
Using Jira at every stage of this project, you can create user stories, test cases and test executions, etc. I created. Throughout the project process, I implemented testing processes by working on various scenarios. All data and scenarios in this project were designed by me for learning purposes and no directives or data of any real company were used.

Industry Practices and Experience
This project allowed me to gain competence in software testing by simulating scenarios that may be encountered in real-world applications. Similar to practices in the insurance industry, in this project I tested the accuracy and reliability of user registration processes.

Industry Practices and Experience
This project helped me gain the following experiences by implementing software testing and quality assurance processes:

Creating test scenarios
Writing test cases
Executing test execution processes
Jira usage
Creating and managing industry-standard workflows
Jira and GitHub integration
Creation of custom fields and integration into project processes
Testing the AOK application with test automation tools such as Java, Selenium and Appium, etc.
